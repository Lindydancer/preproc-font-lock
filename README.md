*Preproc Font Lock* is an Emacs package that highlight C-style
preprocessor directives. The main feature is support for macros
that span multiple lines.

Preproc Font Lock is implemented as two minor modes:
`preproc-font-lock-mode` and `preproc-font-lock-global-mode`. The
former can be applied to individual buffers and the latter to all
buffers.

## Installation

Place this package in a directory in the load-path. To activate it,
use *customize* or place the following lines in a suitable init
file:

       (require 'preproc-font-lock)
       (preproc-font-lock-global-mode 1)

## Customization

You can customize this package using the following:

* `preproc-font-lock-preprocessor-background` -- The *face* used to
  highlight the preprocessor directive
* `preproc-font-lock-modes` -- A list of major modes. A buffer is
  highlighted if it's major mode is, or is derived from, a member
  of this list.
